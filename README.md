# ProstheticFoot_Analysis
This is the code that was created from the University of Vermont SEED Project to design a new prosthetic foot that performs well in biomechanics tests while being easy to produce in Tanzania by TATCOT. Scripts to import VICON '.trc' and AMTI '.mot' files are used to then analyze Effective Foot Length Ratio (EFLR) and heel-strike impact
